Title: Where's my NBN?
Body: The government made a promise to everyday Aussies, and now that promise has been broken! The NBN was supposed to take Australia into the twentieth-first century, but now we're stuck waiting for our lolcats to load, we might as well still be on dial-up!

Title: Boat people are people too!
Body: Too many politicians talk about the plight of refugees like it's some tawdry little geopolitical game. We have to remember that we're talking about people - real people, with real lives. I'd like to see how Ian Macdonald would change his tune if he spent some time in the countries these people are fleeing from.

Title: Climate change - what a swindle
Body: @Pennywrites - climate change - don't make me laugh! More like #climatehoax. You should read some real science - everyone knows that surface temperatures have actually gone down over the last fifteen years - but you wouldn't know it from the malarkey the global warming crackpot conspiracy cabal is pushing down our throats. Sad to see @pennywrites fallen under their spell

Title: Open trade means open trade
Body: @bridgetmckenzie - can't agree with you enough! open trade can only help, not hurt, our Aussie economy - especially as revenues and growth from mining wind down. so let's get competitive and show that we can succeed through classic aussie ingenuity on an even playing field!
