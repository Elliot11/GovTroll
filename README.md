> I'm angry about something!

Great, we're glad you popped by.  Stop being angry and start trying to be part of the solution.  GovTroll can help.

> Pft!  How can you help?

Well, start by searching for the topic you're *'angry'* about.  We'll provide you with a list of Federal MP's who are talking about the same thing in parliament.  Make a post about it on our site and publicly share it with the MP via Email, Twitter, Facebook (depending on what they use).
