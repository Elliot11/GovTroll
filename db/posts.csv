Where's my NBN?,The government made a promise to everyday Aussies, and now that promise has been broken! The NBN was supposed to take Australia into the twentieth-first century, but now we're stuck waiting for our lolcats to load, we might as well still be on dial-up!
Boat people are people too!,Too many politicians talk about the plight of refugees like it's some tawdry little geopolitical game. We have to remember that we're talking about people - real people, with real lives. I'd like to see how Ian Macdonald would change his tune if he spent some time in the countries these people are fleeing from.
Climate change - what a swindle,@Pennywrites - climate change - don't make me laugh! More like #climatehoax. You should read some real science - everyone knows that surface temperatures have actually gone down over the last fifteen years - but you wouldn't know it from the malarkey the global warming crackpot conspiracy cabal is pushing down our throats. Sad to see @pennywrites fallen under their spell
Open trade means open trade,@bridgetmckenzie - can't agree with you enough! open trade can only help, not hurt, our Aussie economy - especially as revenues and growth from mining wind down. so let's get competitive and show that we can succeed through classic aussie ingenuity on an even playing field!
